But even those scale economies had limits above a certain size. As a result, in most retail banking markets, a few large institutions, operating at similar efficiency ratios, dominate market share. Changes to the retail banking business model have mostly come in response to regulatory shifts, as opposed to a purposeful reimagining of what the winning bank of the future will look like. Retail banks have also not kept pace with the improvements in customer experience seen in other consumer industries. Few banks stand out for innovation in customer interaction models or branch formats. Marketing investments have traditionally focused on brand building and increasing loyalty: a reputable brand stood for trust and security and became a moat, providing protection against new entrants to the sector. Finally, most banks offer similar products, with limited innovation in features. Today, the moats that banks have built are more likely to restrict their own progress than protect them from attackers. Four shifts are reshaping the global retail banking landscape to the point where banks need to fundamentally rethink what it takes to compete and win. This should be an urgent priority for banks. The pace of change will likely accelerate, with a select set of large-scale winners emerging in the next three to five years that will gain share in their core markets and begin to compete across borders, leaving many sub-scale institutions scrambling for relevance. Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape 2Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape Four shifts are reshaping retail banking Four secular shifts are changing the way retail banks will compete in the coming years:    The traditional distribution-led growth formula is losing relevance, with a breakdown in the relationship between branch footprint and growth. Banks are now competing on customer experience, with leaders growing faster than their competitors.    Scale economics are back—banks that excel at deploying new technologies (e.g., automation and machine learning) and those with a more digital-centric channel mix will have a structural cost advantage.    The retail banking relationship is getting unbundled along product lines, fueled by digitization and, increasingly, by regulation— and the biggest profit pools are under attack. A few banks will be able to temper and reverse this trend, using superior data and analytics capabilities to build deeper and broader relationships with their customers. In the near term, these shifts will combine to intensify competition as new entrants and incumbents seek to push past traditional boundaries. More than 100 digital attacker banks have launched in the last few years globally— including N26, Monzo and Revolut in Europe; WeBank, Digibank, Jenius in Asia; SoFi, Marcus, Moven in the US; Nubank in South America— while many incumbents have launched or are considering launching digital-first models.  Over the next three to five years, we expect a few players to emerge from this competitive scrum to gain dominant share in their core markets and possibly beyond. These firms will have taken bold and decisive actions to capitalize on the shifts that are reshaping the industry. In some cases, these winners will be incumbents that build on an already significant share; in others, they will be institutions newer to the banking industry, which use their agility, strategic aggressiveness, and sharp execution to attract customers.   1. The traditional distribution-led growth formula no longer applies Until the financial crisis in 2007, a retail bank’s total share of deposits was tightly linked to the size of its branch network. Even as internet use grew rapidly, customers still visited branches for account servicing and to learn about and purchase new products. The physical branch created a sense of security and trust. Banks with higher branch density benefited from a network effect—the more branches, the higher the likelihood of acquiring and retaining customers. Over the past decade, this relationship between deposit growth and branch density has weakened. Deposits at the 25 largest US retail banks have doubled over the past decade, while their combined branch footprint shrank by 15 percent over the same period. This reverse correlation is even sharper for the top five US banks—while reducing branches by 15 percent, they increased deposits by 2.6 times ( Exhibit 1). While there have been previous periods of branch contraction, they were clearly tied to economic downturns; this most recent wave of retrenchment commenced about a decade ago and has persisted through a period of robust economic growth. Retail banking branch networks are contracting across North America, the UK, and Europe (Exhibit 2, page 4), although the pace of change varies considerably between regions. Those that are ahead of the curve have reduced branches by as much as 71 percent (Netherlands). Banks in North America and Southern Europe are 3Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape reducing branches and growing digital sales at a more gradual rate. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, branch reduction is not so apparent—only because retail banks in these markets leapfrogged branch distribution to go directly to digital sales. The rate of branch reduction is often tied to customer willingness to purchase banking products online or on mobile devices. Eighty to ninety percent of banking customers in the Nordics, for example, are open to digital product purchases for most financial products, compared to 50 to 60 percent in North America and Southern Europe ( Exhibit 3, page 5). While customer willingness to purchase products via digital channels varies, however, the common thread is that in all markets this readiness is far ahead of actual digital sales and will require banks to catch up to consumer needs and expectations.\"\"\""

    "document2 = \"\"\"Customer experience is beginning to gener- ate meaningful separation in growth Across all retail businesses—including banks— customers now expect interactions to be simple, intuitive, and seamlessly connected across physical and digital touchpoints.  Banks are investing in meeting these expectations but have struggled to keep pace—focusing on the less-than-lofty goal of making the experience “less bad” for customers, rather than “outstanding.” Many banks are hampered by legacy IT infrastructures and siloed data. As a result, few banks are true leaders in terms of customer experience. Even for leading institutions, typically only one-half to two-thirds of customers rate their experience as excellent. This holds true across product categories, including those such as cards and deposits that have higher digital adoption rates.  The impact of this less-than-stellar performance is measurable. For example, McKinsey analysis shows that in the US, top-quartile banks in terms of experience have had meaningfully higher deposit growth over the past three years ( Exhibit 5, page 8). Simply being good does not move the needle; customer impact really shows when banks offer outstanding experiences. The few “experience leaders” emerging in retail banking are generating higher growth than their peers by attracting new customers and deepening relationships with their existing customer base. Highly satisfied customers are two-and-a-half times more likely to open new accounts/products with their existing bank than those who are merely satisfied; they are also less price sensitive and generate positive word of mouth. These experience leaders are adopting tactics pioneered by digital-native companies in other sectors such as ecommerce, travel, and entertainment: setting a “north star” based on proven markers of differentiated experience (e.g., UX design, carrying context across channels), redesigning journeys that matter most for digital- first customers and not just digital-only customers, and establishing integrated real-time measurement that cuts across products, channels, and employees. These banks know that customer experience is not just about the front- end look and feel, but that it requires discipline, focus, and investment in the following actions:    Focus on the journeys and sub-journeys that matter: The relative contribution of sub- journeys (e.g., app downloading; activating account) in determining overall customer experience varies considerably. In fact, ten to fifteen sub-journeys have the biggest customer satisfaction impact for most products and should thus be the first priority. For instance, when opening a new deposit account, the researching options sub-journey has eight times the impact on customer satisfaction than other account-opening sub- journeys, on average ( Exhibit 6, page 9). For banks, the key is to prioritize these high- impact sub-journeys and systematically redesign them from scratch—a process that can take about three to four months and result in at least a 15 to 20 percent lift in customer satisfaction.   Change the way you engage with customers. Experience leaders understand that digitization is not just about creating a cutting-edge online and mobile experience, and that satisfaction is shaped by customer experience across channels.1 The experience should be seamless, especially on journeys that are more likely to take place over multiple channels, such as new account opening, financial 1  Walter Rizzi and Zubin Taraporevala, “The balancing act: Omnichannel excellence in retail banking,” McKinsey.com, January 2019. 8Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape advice, or issue resolution. One wealth manager equipped its front-line relationship managers with robo-advice algorithms that are in sync with what customers see on the self- directed channel—and provided the RMs with daily and weekly next-best-action recommendations to nudge their clients. Banks need to deploy these tools broadly and empower their front-line staff to play a more consultative role that blends human and digital recommendations. They will also need to revisit how these employees are incentivized, shifting to a longer-term view of relationships and profitability rather than just product sales. Translate data into personalized products and real-time offers. The amount of data available on individual customers or prospects has exploded in recent years. The challenge is to convert this data into actionable nudges and highly relevant offers for customers that are delivered at the right moment. Credit card companies have long offered discounts on specific spending categories or with specific retailers. Today, however, they can improve loyalty and share of spending by providing location-specific offers right when a customer enters a coffee shop, movie theater, or car dealership.

However, beyond a certain point, even larger institutions struggle to eke out efficiencies or realize benefits from scale. For example, even after several years of cost-cutting after the most recent financial crisis, large US retail banks have not made material improvements in productivity over the past decade (Exhibit 8).   We expect this paradigm to change over the next few years, as structural improvements in efficiency ratios and increasing returns to scale enable some large banks to become even more efficient. The reason is two-fold: first, advances in technologies such as robotic process automation, machine learning, and cognitive artificial intelligence—many of which are now mainstream and commercially viable—are unleashing a new wave of productivity improvements for financial institutions.\"\"\""

Even as internet use grew rapidly, customers still visited branches for account servicing and to learn about and purchase new products. The physical branch created a sense of security and trust. Banks with higher branch density benefited from a network effect—the more branches, the higher the likelihood of acquiring and retaining customers. Over the past decade, this relationship between deposit growth and branch density has weakened. Deposits at the 25 largest US retail banks have doubled over the past decade, while their combined branch footprint shrank by 15 percent over the same period. This reverse correlation is even sharper for the top five US banks—while reducing branches by 15 percent, they increased deposits by 2.6 times ( Exhibit 1). While there have been previous periods of branch contraction, they were clearly tied to economic downturns; this most recent wave of retrenchment commenced about a decade ago and has persisted through a period of robust economic growth. Retail banking branch networks are contracting across North America, the UK, and Europe (Exhibit 2, page 4), although the pace of change varies considerably between regions. Those that are ahead of the curve have reduced branches by as much as 71 percent (Netherlands). Banks in North America and Southern Europe are 3Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape reducing branches and growing digital sales at a more gradual rate. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, branch reduction is not so apparent—only because retail banks in these markets leapfrogged branch distribution to go directly to digital sales. The rate of branch reduction is often tied to customer willingness to purchase banking products online or on mobile devices. Eighty to ninety percent of banking customers in the Nordics, for example, are open to digital product purchases for most financial products, compared to 50 to 60 percent in North America and Southern Europe ( Exhibit 3, page 5). While customer willingness to purchase products via digital channels varies, however, the common thread is that in all markets this readiness is far ahead of actual digital sales and will require banks to catch up to consumer needs and expectations.\n",

      "Retail banking branch networks are contracting across North America, the UK, and Europe (Exhibit 2, page 4), although the pace of change varies considerably between regions. As a result, in most retail banking markets, a few large institutions, operating at similar efficiency ratios, dominate market share. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, branch reduction is not so apparent—only because retail banks in these markets leapfrogged branch distribution to go directly to digital sales. The retail banking relationship is getting unbundled along product lines, fueled by digitization and, increasingly, by regulation— and the biggest profit pools are under attack. Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape Retail banks have long competed on distribution, realizing economies of scale through network effects and investments in brand and infrastructure. Finally, most banks offer similar products, with limited innovation in features. Deposits at the 25 largest US retail banks have doubled over the past decade, while their combined branch footprint shrank by 15 percent over the same period.\n",

      "Original: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape Retail banks have long competed on distribution, realizing economies of scale through network effects and investments in brand and infrastructure. But even those scale economies had limits above a certain size. As a result, in most retail banking markets, a few large institutions, operating at similar efficiency ratios, dominate market share. Changes to the retail banking business model have mostly come in response to regulatory shifts, as opposed to a purposeful reimagining of what the winning bank of the future will look like. Retail banks have also not kept pace with the improvements in customer experience seen in other consumer industries. Few banks stand out for innovation in customer interaction models or branch formats. Marketing investments have traditionally focused on brand building and increasing loyalty: a reputable brand stood for trust and security and became a moat, providing protection against new entrants to the sector. Finally, most banks offer similar products, with limited innovation in features. Today, the moats that banks have built are more likely to restrict their own progress than protect them from attackers. Four shifts are reshaping the global retail banking landscape to the point where banks need to fundamentally rethink what it takes to compete and win. This should be an urgent priority for banks. The pace of change will likely accelerate, with a select set of large-scale winners emerging in the next three to five years that will gain share in their core markets and begin to compete across borders, leaving many sub-scale institutions scrambling for relevance. Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape 2Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape Four shifts are reshaping retail banking Four secular shifts are changing the way retail banks will compete in the coming years:    The traditional distribution-led growth formula is losing relevance, with a breakdown in the relationship between branch footprint and growth. Banks are now competing on customer experience, with leaders growing faster than their competitors.    Scale economics are back—banks that excel at deploying new technologies (e.g., automation and machine learning) and those with a more digital-centric channel mix will have a structural cost advantage.    The retail banking relationship is getting unbundled along product lines, fueled by digitization and, increasingly, by regulation— and the biggest profit pools are under attack. A few banks will be able to temper and reverse this trend, using superior data and analytics capabilities to build deeper and broader relationships with their customers. In the near term, these shifts will combine to intensify competition as new entrants and incumbents seek to push past traditional boundaries. More than 100 digital attacker banks have launched in the last few years globally— including N26, Monzo and Revolut in Europe; WeBank, Digibank, Jenius in Asia; SoFi, Marcus, Moven in the US; Nubank in South America— while many incumbents have launched or are considering launching digital-first models.  Over the next three to five years, we expect a few players to emerge from this competitive scrum to gain dominant share in their core markets and possibly beyond. These firms will have taken bold and decisive actions to capitalize on the shifts that are reshaping the industry. In some cases, these winners will be incumbents that build on an already significant share; in others, they will be institutions newer to the banking industry, which use their agility, strategic aggressiveness, and sharp execution to attract customers.   1. The traditional distribution-led growth formula no longer applies Until the financial crisis in 2007, a retail bank’s total share of deposits was tightly linked to the size of its branch network. Even as internet use grew rapidly, customers still visited branches for account servicing and to learn about and purchase new products. The physical branch created a sense of security and trust. Banks with higher branch density benefited from a network effect—the more branches, the higher the likelihood of acquiring and retaining customers. Over the past decade, this relationship between deposit growth and branch density has weakened. Deposits at the 25 largest US retail banks have doubled over the past decade, while their combined branch footprint shrank by 15 percent over the same period. This reverse correlation is even sharper for the top five US banks—while reducing branches by 15 percent, they increased deposits by 2.6 times ( Exhibit 1). While there have been previous periods of branch contraction, they were clearly tied to economic downturns; this most recent wave of retrenchment commenced about a decade ago and has persisted through a period of robust economic growth. Retail banking branch networks are contracting across North America, the UK, and Europe (Exhibit 2, page 4), although the pace of change varies considerably between regions. Those that are ahead of the curve have reduced branches by as much as 71 percent (Netherlands). Banks in North America and Southern Europe are 3Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape reducing branches and growing digital sales at a more gradual rate. In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, branch reduction is not so apparent—only because retail banks in these markets leapfrogged branch distribution to go directly to digital sales. The rate of branch reduction is often tied to customer willingness to purchase banking products online or on mobile devices. Eighty to ninety percent of banking customers in the Nordics, for example, are open to digital product purchases for most financial products, compared to 50 to 60 percent in North America and Southern Europe ( Exhibit 3, page 5). While customer willingness to purchase products via digital channels varies, however, the common thread is that in all markets this readiness is far ahead of actual digital sales and will require banks to catch up to consumer needs and expectations.\n",

this most recent wave of retrenchment commenced about a decade ago and has persisted through a period of robust economic growth.', 'Retail banking branch networks are contracting across North America, the UK, and Europe (Exhibit  2 , page  4 ), although the pace of change varies considerably between regions.', 'Those that are ahead of the curve have reduced branches by as much as  71  percent (Netherlands).', 'Banks in North America and Southern Europe are  3 Rewriting the rules: Succeeding in the new retail banking landscape reducing branches and growing digital sales at a more gradual rate.', 'In many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, branch reduction is not so apparent—only because retail banks in these markets leapfrogged branch distribution to go directly to digital sales.', 'The rate of branch reduction is often tied to customer willingness to purchase banking products online or on mobile devices.', 'Eighty to ninety percent of banking customers in the Nordics, for example, are open to digital product purchases for most financial products, compared to  50  to  60  percent in North America and Southern Europe ( Exhibit  3 , page  5 ).', 'While customer willingness to purchase products via digital channels varies, however, the common thread is that in all markets this readiness is far ahead of actual digital sales and will require banks to catch up to consumer needs and expectations.']\n"
